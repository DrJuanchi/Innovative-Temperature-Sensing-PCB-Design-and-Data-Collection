# Innovative-Temperature-Sensing-PCB-Design-and-Data-Collection


Alp Technologies is an engineering startup
working on a modular battery system called the BRIC.
One issue with this battery pack is that, in the case of
a fault, the company is unable to pinpoint what cell is
causing these issues. In this project, we aim to introduce
temperature sensors into the BRIC to aid in the detection
of faulty cells in the system. After designing the new BRIC,
we went on to test it and provide a p
